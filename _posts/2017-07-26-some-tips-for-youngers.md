I'm 22 years old now, and study in **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.** The four years I spended in there are so boring and upseting, so it's time to rebuild my life and enjoy the further three years.

The reason why I write this blog is mainly for my lover **yy**, she is so beatiful and lovely but I am so sorry to make her feeling yawnful because of my boring life. I love her, and I will review this blog again and again in the future.

Here are some principle I will obey:

1.  **Reading news every day.** I will persist in reading news everyday, no matter how busy I am.  
2.  **Making friends, and talking with friends.** I guarantee spend some time to talking with my friends everyday, of course, the topic will must not be related to programming and so on. I won't live a boring life, and learning more about life from them. **Reading more books about psychology and communication** is also necessary for me. My aim is not talking more, but making talking interesting.
3.  **Do sports.** At least my body should support me to get what I want.
4.  **Professional knowledge.** I still love them, and hoping they won't leave me alone.
